Idea #1
The first idea is to have a user input some pictures representing their mood and/or feelings. The items in the images will 
be analyzed using the Clarifai API to identify the main objects present in the images which will be used to choose a genre of 
music in the Spotify API playlist to recommend a certain playlist/song to the user. Users will login using Twitter(or possibly 
spotify authentication, still doing research). I am planning to use a local database acting as the cache.

Idea #2
I'm not so impressed with the firt idea, but I'm also having a hard time coming up with a better idea. Currently, I'm still brain
storming by looking through some API lists.
